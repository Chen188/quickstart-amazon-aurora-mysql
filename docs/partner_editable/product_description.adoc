Amazon Aurora is a fully managed relational database engine thatâ€™s compatible with MySQL and
PostgreSQL. MySQL and PostgreSQL combine the speed and reliability of high-end
commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases.
The code, tools, and applications you use today with your existing MySQL and PostgreSQL
databases can be used with Aurora. With some workloads, Aurora can deliver up to five 
times the throughput of MySQL and up to three times the throughput of PostgreSQL
without requiring changes to most of your existing applications.

Aurora includes a high-performance storage subsystem. Its database engines are
customized to take advantage of that fast distributed storage. The underlying storage grows
automatically as needed, up to 64 terabytes. Aurora also automates and standardizes
database clustering and replication, which are typically among the most challenging aspects
of database configuration and administration.

Aurora is part of the managed database service Amazon Relational Database Service
(Amazon RDS). Amazon RDS is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and
scale a relational database in the cloud. If you are not already familiar with Amazon RDS,
see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html/[Amazon Relational Database Service User Guide].

You can choose Aurora as a DB engine option when setting up new database servers
through Amazon RDS. Aurora provides the following features:

* Aurora takes advantage of the Amazon RDS features for management and
administration. It uses the Amazon RDS AWS Management Console interface, AWS
Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) commands, and API operations to handle routine
database tasks such as provisioning, patching, backup, recovery, failure detection, and
repair.

* Aurora management operations typically involve entire clusters of database servers that
are synchronized through replication, instead of individual database instances. The
automatic clustering, replication, and storage allocation make it simple and costeffective to set up, operate, and scale your largest PostgreSQL deployments.

* You can bring data from Amazon RDS for MySQL into Aurora by creating and
restoring snapshots, or by setting up one-way replication. You can use push-button
migration tools to convert your existing Amazon RDS for MySQL applications to
Aurora.
