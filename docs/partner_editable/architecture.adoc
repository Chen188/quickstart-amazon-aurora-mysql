As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to
provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** (Optional) A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in the private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** An Aurora database cluster that includes one database reader and one database writer.
* An encryption key using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). The key enables encryption at rest for the Aurora database cluster.
* An Amazon CloudWatch alarm to monitor the CPU on the bastion host and send alarm notifications using Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips
the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC
configuration.
