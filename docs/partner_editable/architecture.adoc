As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

The Quick Start sets up the following:
* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to
provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets, managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow
outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* In the public subnets, an optional Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow
inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
instances in the private subnets.*
* In the private subnets, an Aurora DB cluster that includes one DB reader and one DB
writer.
* An encryption key using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). The Quick Start
uses the key to enable encryption at rest for the Aurora DB cluster.
* An Amazon CloudWatch alarm to monitor the CPU on the bastion host and send an
Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification when the alarm is
triggered.

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips
the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC
configuration.
