This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for
deploying an Amazon Aurora MySQL database on the AWS Cloud with high availability
and failover support. 

This Quick Start is for users who are looking for a repeatable, customizable reference
deployment for Aurora MySQL using AWS CloudFormation. You can also use the Quick
Start as a building block in your own automated deployments by using the existing-VPC

components and is designed to plug into your existing AWS CloudFormation templates as a
drop-in MySQL database replacement.
